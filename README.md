⚠️ Project is on hold for now, busy with other thing but might get back to it if Thingiverse keeps being unreliable

The goal of this project is to create a 3D file hosting website, ... or learn more about web dev while failing at that.

If you have ever used Thingiverse you will now that the website can often be slow, unresponsive and worst of all their search function is basically useless as unless you know the exact name of what you are looking for it won't find anything. Those are the main things that I dislike about the website and is why I have decided to try to create a solution that I would prefer as a challenge to myself and a way to learn more about all angles of web development.

Progress is currently slow but I am planning to start working on this much more after winter break.

~~A preview version of the website can be accessed at: www.stlstuff.com~~ shut down servers as didn't really make sense to keep them running while this is on pause


If you want to help out with this let me know and I might create a discord server similarly to what I have done with the MSU.
