# STLstuff

The goal of this project is to create a thingiverse alternative for 3D file hosting and sharing, ... or learn more about web dev while failing at that.
On top of that I am looking into implementing a better searh algorithm(Elasticsearch or similar), discoverability features and more.
The site(currently in dev but already got the domain) can be accessed at: www.stlstuff.com
